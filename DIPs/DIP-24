-----Summary of Proposal-----
__Simple Summary__
The Women Leaders in Web3 Community Hub will be the center for all communities striving towards diversity, equity, and inclusion for women in Ethereum. 

-----Abstract-----
Our hub will welcome women, nonbinary people, and allies to learn about Ethereum in a safe space. Our hub will highlight feminist and intersectional academics and literature as well as the history of women in computing. Our hub will provide a combination of educational talks, interactive art, and intimate bonding sessions. The Women in Web3 Hub will be open from October 11 to October 14 from 9am to 5pm.

Everyone in the Ethereum community is welcome to our hub, and we especially want allies of women to attend our programming.

-----Motivation & Rationale-----
Women represent a low percentage of attendees at Ethereum and web3 events in general. Our community hub seeks to solve this problem by providing an inclusive space to learn, ask questions, and network with other powerful women in the Ethereum community.

-----Implementation-----
This community hub will be lead by a coalition of amazing LATAM women communities including Blu3 DAO LATAM, HER DAO LATAM, Metagals, Surge Women, CryptoMujeresDAO, and Technolatinas. All of our communities are extremely experienced event organizers and have lead successful events during ETHDenver, ETHRio, ETHAmsterdam, ETHNewYork, and ETHMexicoCity.
