# Summary of Proposal

DevCon Bogota will support several Community Hubs which are dedicated physical spaces for communities around specific initiatives, interests, and collectives. This DIP aims to establish a **Community Hub for Web3 developer community builders to network, host talks, interviews, share best practices and more**.

# Abstract

The Web3 Dev Community Building Hub will be an inclusive hub for everyone interested in attracting more developers to Ethereum. Here, developer community builders can share ideas, create synergies, and host discussions on how to effectively attract, retain and engage developers.

In our protocol-driven ecosystem, it is critical that not only that Web3 organizations have sound products and user bases, but also a vibrant developer community to further the application of decentralized tech stacks and drive adoption. It’s also clearly important for Ethereum as a whole - the more developers creating applications on top of Ethereum, the more potential growth that our industry can capture.

The goal of this Community Hub is to foster stronger connections between different developer communities, cross-pollinate best practices amongst them, and share ideas and tools in pursuit of onboarding a million new developers to Ethereum.


# Motivation & Rationale

An open source tech stack is only as valuable as the community around it that adopts and builds on it. Developer community building is an important subject to the vast majority of organizations in our space. The Community Hub would provide a focal point for individuals across Web3 organizations who are concerned with fostering dev communities and relations to convene, share, and learn.

We’re striving to build a *diverse* hub, with representatives from developer communities in multiple Geographies, with Europe (HomeDAO), India (DevFolio, Questbook), Latam (BLU3DAO, HerDAO LATAM), and North America (ETHGlobal).

# Implementation
- Has any part of this proposal been implemented at other events? If so, please describe how it went.

This is a brand new idea. We are looking to put on a great experience and rinse+repeat for future IRL conferences.

- Do you require feedback or data from attendees post-event?

No.

# Operational Requirements & Ownership

## 1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon?

Simply a physical space Community Hub space set up. We would ideally like:
- A clear area for standing networking
- A seated area for roundtable discussions and relaxation
- A few desks
- Accommodation for a TV to assist with maintaining discussion topics or presentation slides.
- A livestream corner which will connect IRL participants with people at home.

We cannot offer an exact layout as we have not been given venue layout information.

## 2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? (i.e. working on Day 0)

DevCon Bogota venue support would be necessary to gather the necessary equipment into place before the conference begins on Oct 11, 2022. 

From there, the individuals listed in the [RFP](https://forum.devcon.org/t/building-web3-developer-communities-hub-proposal/849) (harking from Polygon, The Graph, Superfluid, and more) will begin a series of activities, discussions, and themed sessions to engage attendees.

## 3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))
