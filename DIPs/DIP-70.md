## Summary of Proposal

### Simple Summary

A free, open, volunteer‑run recording station inside Devconnect to document hallway‑track conversations and build a shared archive—participants keep ownership; we provide equipment, recording, light guidance, and post‑production.

### 50‑word summary

Zk Av Club sets up a media lab that anyone can use to record conversations. Nothing is livestreamed (with experimental exceptions, like collab with Swarm or something); recordings respect privacy, guest‑approved, and later released. Edited pieces publish first; afterwards, source masters are archived to Internet Archive under Creative Commons CC BY‑SA, building an open, remixable documentary.

## Abstract

The Zk Av Club Recording Station is a free and open media lab designed to host conversations among attendees and bring hallway discussions into the collective memory. It is volunteer‑run, open‑source and decentralized: we don’t drive the narrative; we provide space, equipment, and facilitation so people can record podcast‑style or quick reflections. Nothing is livestreamed by default; everything is recorded and processed post‑event.

Participants own their content. They grant Zk Av Club a non‑exclusive license to edit, publish, clip, and archive; in return, we give them the raw material. Edited releases publish first; following approvals, source masters are uploaded to Internet Archive under CC BY‑SA with full credits and metadata. Donations primarily support post‑production (editing, mastering, captioning, metadata) rather than on‑site costs. The activation invites community members to learn by doing and decentralizes the post-production workload (video editing, audio cleanup, captioning, etc.).

## Motivation & Rationale

* **Enhancing attendee experience:** Creates a friendly, chill spot to sit down, reflect, and record—turning fleeting hallway exchanges into durable, shareable knowledge.
* **Community self‑representation:** People speak for themselves—not via a selection filter—strengthening inclusive narratives and memory.
* **Consent-first, participant-owned media:** Explicit consent at every step and decentralized contribution to post-production.

## Implementation

* **Prior activations:** Deployed at Berlin Blockchain Week 2025 (Funding the Commons, Protocol Berg v2, Decentralized Media Summit, Dappcon, ZK Hack) and Dark Prague; typical output \~20–40 recorded sessions over a week, 10–45 minutes each.
* **On‑site flow:** Day 0 setup; cameras, mics, lights and seats; record‑only (no live); crew support with prompts/optional host.
* **Formats supported:** Podcast‑style conversations; short‑form interviews; panel recaps & reactions; personal video journals; experimental/creative pieces.
* **Distribution & licensing:** Edited release first on Zk Av Club and/or co‑creator channels; then publish sources to Internet Archive under CC BY‑SA; include credits/metadata.
* **Post‑event collaboration:** Consent confirmation; community editing (audio cleanup, multicam edits, captions); archive + return raw files to participants; community signal‑boost.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

1. **Actions required at Devconnect**

   * Space (ideally ≈6×6m). It works best when we’re out in the open where people can see us and wander by to check it out. 
   * 1 table for equipment, 1 small table for guests, seating for guests and crew (~5). 
   * 1 whiteboard for signage would be great, or 1 flip chart with a stand. 
   * Access to power.

2. **Responsible parties**

   * **Production core:** Project lead + Tech director
   * **Support team:** Operators/hosts (open to attendees; brief training provided)

3. **Potential integrations**

   * Devconnect media/documentation team.
   * Content creators, hackers, philosophers, anthropologists and DevRel in the Devconnect community.
   * Captioning/translation collectives; archives/research groups. 
   * Ethereum tech for provenance, streaming/storage for large media, or other FOSS/P2P experiments.
