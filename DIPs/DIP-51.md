## Summary of Proposal
Inspired by the success of the Design Hub at Devcon 6 and driven by the understanding that design, user research, and marketing are three pillars of decentralized tech adoption, we (see the list of collaborators below) propose to organize an Adoption Hub at Devcon 7.

## Goals of the Adoption Hub
From hands-on co-working sessions and workshops to jams and fun activities, it is where designers researchers and marketers aim to:
- Share their knowledge with projects and teams who are looking to give momentum to their user adoption.
- Meet each other to cross-pollinate ideas and collaboratively push our design+research+marketing efforts forward.
- Help the Ethereum ecosystem find new strategies to increase user adoption.
- Facilitate conversations between developers and designers and increase the potential for collaboration after the event.

## Audiences
While designers researchers and marketers are the content creators of the Hub programming, we also aim to attract:
- Web3 founders and teams looking for advice on driving users to their platforms.
- Designers researchers and marketers NEW to the Web3 space who are looking for mentorship or advice as they get involved with the Web3 community
- Activists artists and makers who want to explore how we can co-create a more user-friendly inclusive and environmentally conscious decentralized web by making ideas heard and put them into action.

## Programming
Over the course of four days, we will guide participants through the journey of user adoption by following best practices from web3-native design, research, and marketing. As a team progresses along its roadmap, we aim to provide the most effective and actionable steps to increase the trust and usage of a project or protocol.
All sessions and activities will be scheduled in order of relevance to a team’s growth stage. As a result, visitors should identify their current stage by looking at the schedule, and recognize the bottlenecks (and needs) that slow down their progress. The sessions will be designed to effectively address those bottlenecks and gain momentum to successfully reach the project’s upcoming goals.
While the detailed programming is in the making as we involve more collaborators, below is a list of activity types we are planning to run in the Hub:
1. Hands-on workshops:
    - Building a success-driven team to create high-value infrastructure
    - Brand Lab or reverse-engineering reputation through visual design
    - Web 3 marketing acquisition strategies
    - Crafting a values-based brand narrative to build a regenerative community
    - Conversion Rate Optimization in crypto - how to articulate return on investment
    - What magic can teach us about designing delightful experiences
    - Finding adoption signals with low-cost no-code experiments.
    - more topics to come
2. UX audits
3. Open design sprints
4. Design clinics (product + communication)
5. Ask Us Anything
6. Maker jams
7. Mentoring hours
8. Design/research/marketing memes wall
9. Best practices in UX and GTM strategies

## Equipment & Production Needs
Space, program visibility on the main website, else TBD
