## Summary of Proposal
We want to create an inspiring space to discuss key challenges to governance design & coordination. Each day, we will facilitate discussions around engaging governance topics, encourage an exchange of ideas, resources and experiences amongst participants, and host office hours with the governance leads and facilitators hosting the Hub.

## Abstract
This Hub will offer “governance geeks” a chance to tap into the collective intelligence and experience of Governance Leads and Facilitators from various major DAOs who will be facilitating the Hub. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current governance structures, the tools and infrastructure supporting DAOs, and the legal, financial, operational considerations critical to their success. We’ll explore both past and future trends, and discuss the developments in DAO governance that concerns and excite us most.

## Motivation & Rationale
Creating spaces that bring together diverse perspectives and stakeholders to share experiences and ideas is essential for developing sustainable solutions that enhance the governance experience. Whether someone is interested in working on governance design or participating in governance as a stakeholder or contributor, this session will be relevant to them.

To ensure these discussions and learnings do not stay with those who participate, we want to produce a summary of the discussions in the form of a blog or forum post for each day of the Hub.

## Implementation
The Hub will tentatively operate between 10:00 and 3:00 pm each day. Below is the tentative schedule for each day.

- 10:00 - 10:15 - Intro: Who is “in the room” today
- 10:15 - 11:15 - 1 Hour Discussion / Workshop (see potential topics above)
- 11:15 - 11:30 - Break
- 11:30 - 12:30 - Collective Intelligence Round - This is an open discussion time where anyone can ask a question or present a problem to the group and tap into our “collective intelligence” to hopefully get an answer or at least a lead.
- 12:30 - 3:00 - Office Hours / Co-working

Each day will have a different theme and people leading the discussion. Some potential workshop and discussion topics include: 

- Delegation - Where we are today vs where we should be
- Governance “experience” design
- “Build a DAO from scratch”: If you were to build a DAO from scratch today, how would you design governance/launch a token/incentivize participation?
- Quadratic voting - a time and a place
- Finding the right sustainable funding mechanisms for your community
- Councils: Accountability, empowerment, transparency, reporting & incentivization


## Operational Requirements & Ownership
### Equipment & production requirements for the space:
In decreasing order of importance.

- Seating: Ideally mix of cozy & functional for discussions and work
- Whiteboard/flip charts for workshopping
- Power outlets
- TV or screen for presentations
- A few small tables
- Signage (simple sign with Hub name so folks know where to find us)

### Actions to Implement: 1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)?

### Ownership / Team
The team coordinating the space and facilitating the discussions will be a group of DAO operators who are focused on governance design and coordinating for various major DAOs (e.g. Celo, ZK Nation, EigenLayer, Sky, OP). Participants will be able to tap into the knowledge and experience of these folks, as well as that of other participants.

Governance operators are often connected to every type of stakeholder in a project, and have experienced first hand the trouble-shooting and problem solving around various governance challenges. Governance operators also naturally are community managers, and are well connected to the communities they help facilitate.

**The core Hub coordinators and points of contact will be:**
- Anna Alexa - Governance and Community at Celo Foundation, formerly community at MakerDAO and part of Meta Gamma Delta grants DAO
- Shelby Steidl - Governance Experience Lead at ZKsync Association, formerly Governance Facilitator at Radworks

**Addition Contributors:**

## Links & Additional Information
In order to ensure that this Hub stays free from marketing and avoids promoting specific tokens or projects, we plan to do the following:

- Intention setting: Make sure to open each discussion with a disclaimer and reminder why we are here and what we are not here to discuss (e.g. shill specific projects/tokens)
- Encourage everyone to share their affiliations, interests, etc. to ensure everyone feels represented and included in Hub discussions
- Make sure to pull examples for the presentations and workshops from various projects
