## Summary of Proposal
Devcon should run longer (one week?) to increase its capacity and implement some organisational ideas from the Blockchain Week.

## Abstract
Last Devcons were heavily overloaded in many ways. Too many people in small rooms, too few tickets, too many interesting topics running in parallel. 
We should increase the duration of the Devcon-event up to one week, introduce tickets for selected days, and repeat most wanted presentations and workshops. 

## Motivation & Rationale
The idea of the Blockchain Week was the community answer to the limited capacity of Devcon as the main event. 
Thus, a week seems to be is a good estimation for the optimal event duration (for now). 

## Implementation
**Organizational**
- Devcon should run longer (one week)
- There should be a Full Pass (all days) and Day Passes (for selected days of the week).  
- Most wanted presentation should run twice (or more) on different days. It makes possible to watch most presentations in few days.  
- A conversation area (a lobby) should be open to all participant all the days (up to allowed capacity).

**Technical**
- A ticketing program should allow to selects single days for the devcon tickets. 
- The price depends on the number of selected days. 
- The total number of participants will be calculated per day to fit the venue capacity.
