## Abstract

Create a high-vibe tabletop space at Devconnect where attendees can drop in to play and learn games. Similar to last Devcon, I will host [Memethology](https://memethology.com) sessions; others are welcome to BYO-host their own games in the same area (Mindy mentioned Battlestar Galactica, Nico Shi will offer her beloved crypto-themed tarot reading).

## Rationale

Tabletop play reliably sparks connection and decompression amid conference intensity. Past runs at Devcon/EDCON were packed for hours with friendly competition and collaboration. A visible, high-traffic space compounds this effect and becomes an easy meetup anchor.

## Implementation

* **Location:** High-traffic area (TBD with organizers). Last year used the “Playground Space”; seeking a similarly prominent spot.
* **Footprint:** Minimum **3-5 tables with chairs** (seats ~6-10), expandable if multiple BYO-hosts participate.
* **Daily Tabletop Events**: 2-5 PM
* **Format:** Rolling learn-to-play and casual sessions throughout the day; lightweight raffles or mini-tournaments as time allows.
* **BYO-Host rule:** Anyone who wants a slot must teach/run their own game (positive-sum, decentralized ethos). I’ll be fully focused on Memethology and won’t teach other games, but I strongly encourage other hosts!
* **Materials:** Playmats, signage, and prizes.
* **Comms:** Add sessions to the Devconnect schedule once times/space are confirmed.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

* **Owner:** Colton Orr (program lead + Memethology host).
* **On-site ops:** I’ll manage Memethology teaching, table flow, and vibe. BYO-hosts handle their own rulesets, components, and table etiquette.
* **Org support requested:**

  * Space allocation in a high-traffic area
  * **$1,000** toward accommodations and materials (playmats/signage/prizes)
  * Listing on the official schedule
* **Safety/Conduct:** Follow Devconnect code of conduct; kind, playful, welcoming tables; quick resets between sessions to keep flow.

## Rationale (extended)

Games reduce social friction and create memorable micro-communities. The mix of crypto-native themes (Memethology) and general tabletop favorites makes the space accessible to both builders and plus-ones. A decentralized tabletop area that keeps Devconnect buzzing with friendly play and effortless networking.
