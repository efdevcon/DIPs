## Summary of Proposal
The on-chain ticketing solution that GET Protocol offers could be the perfect fit for Devcon 6. It already meets a lot of the requirements and the team is likely able to facilitate specific innovative demands.

## Abstract
The GET Protocol ticketing solution has already issued over 500K ETH-registered tickets for more than thousands events of events worldwide. Ticketing companies in four countries currently use it to issue fully digital, scalp + fraud proof tickets.


## Motivation & Rationale
Bottom line: GET Protocol can offer an on-chain ticketing solution that is tried and tested. We can ensure an easy and transparent ticketing process that is blockchain friendly and can either offer or integrate innovative features to Devcon 6 visitors.
We can offer a stable ticketing process with a lot of fun blockchain cherries on top. 

## Implementation
Our system has been applied at thousands of events, from concerts to comedyshows to conferences to livestreams. 
Here's coverage from Decrypt about a national comedy tour that was sold out, which also goes a bit into our technical approach:

Another more recent example for large-scale livestream shows:

In practical terms a follow-up discussion can be had between stakeholders on both sides, to align wishes and details from a technical and logistical standpoint.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon?
Several conversations about specific requirements and desired functionalities. Also on topics such as on-site support and practical matters.

2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? (i.e. working on Day 0)
A combined group of our dev team + business developers. 

3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))
We are already in talks with POAP about potential integration to link attendance badges to our digital tickets. This seems like a shoe-in fit. We are certainly open to more of these integrations.
