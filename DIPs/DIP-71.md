## Summary of Proposal

We propose using [Agora Citizen Network](https://www.agoracitizen.network/), during DevConnect 2025 to capture community perspectives on the ecosystem’s evolving priorities, challenges, and opportunities. 


## Abstract

Agora is a simple, open-source deliberation tool for large-scale, data-driven dialogue. Built on Pol.is algorithms, it helps communities collect and make sense of many perspectives to identify consensus and understand division, without flame wars or polarization.

Participants can simply scan a QR code to share their views: no sign-up required, no personal data collected.

The preliminary result of the conversations can be shared during Yuting's talk on [d/acc day](https://luma.com/5zs3pvxx?tk=inkOj7).

## Motivation & Rationale

### For DevConnect attendees

They can participate in large-scale, collective dialogues that complement their in-person discussions on site. Through these consultations, participants can see how their views align or differ from others and engage in decentralized, collective sense-making across the ecosystem.

### For DevConnect organizers and ecosystem leaders

They can gather audience input and distill valuable insights on key ecosystem topics. The results can inform future programming and shape collective decision-making.

### Beyond DevConnect

Observe how ecosystem narratives are shaped collectively. The conversations serve as an example of decentralized coordination in action.

## Implementation

Agora has been successfully piloted by events including UNESCO’s Media & Information Literacy Week 2025 and was used during France’s national strike in September 2025 to help people map disagreement and find alignment.

Our team would continuously gather feedback from attendees and organizers during the pilot.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

### How this works

**Dedicated landing page**: A single [landing page](https://zkorum.github.io/agora-devconnect/)  will host all Agora conversations taking place during DevConnect, making it easy for participants to explore and join ongoing dialogues.

**Conversation set up**: Our team is collaborating with Community Hub organizers including Governance Geeks Hub, Future Cities & Hubs, and d/acc day to co-create the consultation topics.

**Conversation access**: Participants can click on a link from the landing page to enter an Agora discussion and verify the ownership of their DevConnect ticket via **Zupass**.

**Format**: Each discussion consists of short statements; users vote agree / disagree / unsure or suggest new statements.

**Moderation**: The Agora team reviews inputs for relevance and civility although moderated content will still be available in the “moderation history” part of the app.

**Data & privacy**: No accounts, cookies, or personal data, fully GDPR-compliant.

**Outcome**: Each dialogue produces a real-time visual summary of areas of community consensus and divergence.

### Resource Requirements from DevConnect Organizers

**ASAP: need help testing Zupass integration**
- Zupass integration on Agora is deployed and now works in production. We need your help to test it with more DevConnect ticket holders. We created this test conversation: https://www.agoracitizen.app/conversation/tpJoGig

**Communication Support**
- Promote the landing page on DevConnect’s social media channels before and during the event to encourage participation.
- Share conversation links in official DevConnect group chats to invite attendees to join the discussions. 

**On-Site Promotion**
- Display QR codes linking to Agora conversations in suitable areas throughout the event venues (e.g., entrance halls, hubs,  discussion corners, etc).
