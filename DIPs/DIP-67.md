## Abstract

100% open source (https://github.com/cleanappio), CleanApp is the quintessential Ethereum hybrid app. Players take photos of anything they subjectively want ‘cleaned up’ – both in physical & digital Ethereal realms (example: a tripping hazard at the entrance of the Devconnect venue and/or a UX bug in the contract verification script on Etherscan). Our AI analyzes & batches these reports & automatically sends them to relevant responsible/interested parties for fixing. Players get tokens for their insights & feedback.

## Motivation & Rationale

- How does this improve the attendee experience? Robust Ethereum-powered feedback loops that give actionable insights regarding waste/hazards at the conference venue & various Ethereum domains. Shows-not-tells the Ethereum experience. Experienced and novice players can quickly grok the core Etherean mantra of “do work to support the protocol, and the protocol rewards you for your efforts.”
- What Ethereum use case does it showcase? Tokenization-as-incentivization, d/acc, community currencies, censorship-resistance (CleanApp is anon-by-default & strong privacy preserving), dCloud (reports are periodically batch-archived), deSci, dPin, DAOs.

## Implementation

- Have you done this before at another event? Indirectly, informally, yes, including at EthDenver (2025), Devcon SEA (2024), EthZurich, and other meetups.
- How will you make it happen? In its current LIVE embodiment, CleanApp needs no tweaks or upgrades to accommodate a large event like Devconnect. Any user can submit emails of parties who are interested in receiving reports. Once reports come in, they’re AI-analyzed & sent to the interested parties. Think: tripping hazards, cigarette butts at the entrance, fire hazards, digital calendar displaying wrong info, anything a user subjectively identifies as a problem. As more reports come in from other users, the urgency/relevance of the clustered reports grows. No email? No problem. We’re implementing a global addressing scheme that assigns an Ethereum address to every property globally (think GoogleMaps Plus Codes, Ethereum-style). That way, we can send notices directly to property owners, bypassing spam filters. A global addressing system on Ethereum? Yep, that’s right. Ethereum Plus Codes (EPCs), powered by CleanApp\!

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

- What’s needed to make this work at Devcon/nect? We need comms supports & visibility so that attendees & local communities learn about this application & are encouraged to use it. Donated NFTs for geocached jackpots would also be sweet.
- Who will be responsible for running it on site? CleanApp & Smart Transactions team.
- What other projects could this integrate with? POAP, ZuPass, any NFT project that wants to contribute its NFTs into the randomized geocached jackpot pool (like PoolTogether, for NFTs).
