## Abstract
Provide a seamless housing reservation experience for **Devcon[nect]**. This platform, developed by **Betrusty**, allows attendees to **securely and reliably** book verified accommodations during events using decentralized identity and cryptocurrency payments.


## Rationale

### Background
Devconnect (2025) brings together thousands of global participants, but finding accessible and secure housing remains a challenge. Traditional platforms like Airbnb and Booking charge high fees, require fiat payments, and lack integration with on-chain solutions.

**Betrusty** is a web3 tool that solves this issue: it enables users to rent verified properties without commission and pay with crypto. It is already integrated with **Didit** and **Daimo Pay**, offering a frictionless multichain payment experience. As part of our roadmap toward Devconnect (2025), we aim to integrate additional partners from the ecosystem such as **Ensuro, QuarkID, Kleros, and Autopen**, although those are still in progress.

This proposal seeks to simplify the arrival of the Ethereum community to Buenos Aires through a real-world application of digital sovereignty.


## Goals

- Provide a housing solution aligned with Ethereum values: frictionless, trust-based, sovereign, and decentralized.  
- Promote real-world crypto adoption by showcasing how Devconnect (2025) can help bring Argentina’s housing market onchain.  
- Deliver a safe booking experience combining verified identity and crypto payments.  
- Enable attendees to find trustworthy places to stay without intermediaries or commissions.  
- Prevent fraud and scams common in unverified peer-to-peer rentals.  
- Reduce friction for international attendees arriving in Buenos Aires.  
- Showcase how web3 tools can solve tangible problems beyond the event.  
- Promote frictionless multichain payments enabled by Daimo Pay.


## Implementation

### Branded Environment
**Betrusty** will create a **Devconnect-branded landing page**, under a subdomain such as `devconnect.betrusty.io` (to be defined), with the following features:

- Access restricted to verified Devconnect (2025) participants (via promo code or another method).  
- Listings of curated properties from trusted local partners (co-livings, professional hosts).  
- Identity verification via **Didit**.  
- Multichain crypto payments via **Daimo Pay**.  
- Compatible with custodial and non-custodial wallets (Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask and others).  
- The platform is available in four languages—Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French—ensuring accessibility for a diverse, international audience.

In addition to the platform, Betrusty can manage group or custom bookings—ideal for sponsors, organizers, or teams that require entire buildings or multiple rooms. This ensures logistical consistency and reduces booking overhead.

### Booking Flow

1. The user accesses the portal from the Devconnect (2025) ecosystem.  
2. Selects a property.  
3. Submits an application.  
4. The host approves the application.  
5. The user pays with the token and chain of their choice.  
6. The property is booked.

Thanks to **Daimo Pay**, users can pay from any chain without worrying about bridges, swaps, or gas fees. Hosts receive the full amount directly, improving conversion and reducing friction.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

**Betrusty commits to delivering:**
- A fully functional, branded Devconnect (2025) landing page.  
- Integration with Daimo Pay for multichain payments.  
- Technical support before and during the event.

---

## Cost

**For users:**  
- 0% commission on all bookings.  
- 1:1 crypto payments with no additional fees.

**For Devconnect (2025):**  
- No cost.  
- No funding or technical resources required from Devconnect (2025).

---

## Timeline

The Betrusty team already operates a functional environment and has experience with on-chain integrations. The branded landing page can go live within 1 week of approval and requires no technical resources from the Devconnect (2025) team. The design will be shared for prior review.

---

## Conclusion

The solution is entirely opt-in and does not interfere with any existing Devconnect (2025) workflows. It can be communicated as an added benefit without replacing hotel agreements or traditional booking platforms.

If successfully implemented, this collaboration will allow Devconnect (2025) to:

- Provide a decentralized, accessible housing solution aligned with Ethereum values.  
- Offer a smooth, real-world web3 experience that solves a concrete problem.  
- This initiative not only solves a logistical need—it sets a precedent for how global events can actively bring crypto utility to emerging markets.
