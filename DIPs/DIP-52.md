## Summary of Proposal

The Account Abstraction Community Hub would be a gathering point for various sub-communities in the Account Abstraction ecosystem. This includes communities focused around development and maintenance of Account Abstraction SDKs and libraries, wallets, block indexers, bundlers, paymasters, relevant protocol standards (e.g. [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/), [RIP-7560](https://www.rip7560.io/), [RIP-7217](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212), [ERC-6900](https://www.erc6900.io/), [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/) and more), dapps leveraging Account Abstraction, social recovery such as ZK Email, and more.


## Abstract

Account Abstraction has garnered a lot of attention this past year, as many people believe it will play a key role in getting the next 1B users onchain, by removing numerous onboarding and UX pain points for users, while preserving the core values of Ethereum (censorship resistance, decentralization, privacy, etc.). 

There are dozens of teams building in this space, and it would be beneficial to have a dedicated space for everyone to meet, collaborate and learn - both for those teams for cross-pollination and alignment, but also for the builders looking to use Account Abstraction in their projects and can learn and collaborate with said teams as well as other builders.

## Motivation & Rationale

Such a space will be useful for all types of attendees, enabling a wide variety of discussions. For example:

* Highly technical, such as native Account Abstraction implementation or storage management in modular accounts
* UX design questions surrounding global vs embedded wallets, gas sponsorship, cross-chain assets, etc. 
* Economics and game theory in regards to the new public mempool and paymaster design
* Security considerations around key management and account recovery, etc.

### The Hub would have three primary ‚Äúuse cases‚Äù

Firstly, the Account Abstraction Community Hub can be a space for Account Abstraction teams and sub-communities to run informal events. These teams will register for the space in advance for activities such as roundtable discussions, office hours, AMA, etc. Such events would be less structured than a workshop or presentation registered specifically under the official Devcon tracks; they would be more informal, accessible, and open-ended.

Secondly, there will be a number of official AA-related talks and workshops throughout Devcon, and the Account Abstraction Community Hub can serve as the default follow up spot for Account Abstraction track presenters to hang out after their sessions and engage their audience.

Finally, the Account Abstraction Community Hub may serve as a default ‚Äúhangout‚Äù spot or Schelling point for AA-focused attendees, looking to learn about AA and engage other builders.

## Implementation

To dig deeper into the first use case, which we expect to be the core driver of usage of the Community Hub: teams or individuals in the Account Abstraction space may reserve a time slot, during which they would lead informal activities that are open to the Account Abstraction community to participate in, either actively or passively. In the coming weeks we will engage AA-related teams and individuals in the space to formulate a schedule that will become clearer as we get closer to Devcon 7.

We expect that such informal activities could include:

* **Office hours**: An Account Abstraction team may host a meet-and-greet for builders who are interested in developing on top of their libraries and services, giving them a chance to ask their team both technical and non-technical questions
* **AMA**: A chance for community members to pick the brains of relevant thought leaders in the space (e.g authors of EIPs, researchers, senior developers, designers, founders, etc.)
* **Guided demos**: Informal sessions where community members can drop by the Community Hub to try out an Account Abstraction application / wallet / SDK with guidance from a team member.
* **Fireside chats or round-table discussions**: These would be guided discussions on specific topics, led by a domain expert where anyone at Devcon who is interested in the topic may participate in.

We would invite various teams from across the ecosystem to host these activities and help manage the hub. Many of them have already expressed a strong interest in taking part.

The space will be operated from 10am - 4pm, or longer if we have enough support and demand from the AA teams, as well as enough interest from the community itself.

Each day, this period will be broken up into several slots of varying times, depending on the activity.

Different teams will ‚Äúown‚Äù the space during their allocated slot, during which they will drive a ‚Äúprimary activity‚Äù (see the examples above).

Additionally, we imagine that the space will be used informally for follow ups with speakers from the conference, or from other side events.


## Operational Requirements & Ownership

1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon?

We will coordinate with all Account Abstraction teams to build out the schedule. This will be done both by reaching out to teams as well as by posting about it publicly to make sure everyone has a chance to participate.

We will also coordinate with all contributors on the ground, so the hub will be tended at all times during the Devcon opening hours. 

In regards to equipment and production needs from the conference organizers, in decreasing order of priority:

* Seating for discussion groups
* Whiteboards
* Power Outlets
* Desks and tables
* TV-sized screen
* Signage

2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively?

The Ethereum Foundation Account Abstraction PM, Tom Teman ([@tomteman](https://x.com/tomteman)), will be the primary point of contact, supported by his team members - the co-authors of [ERC-4337](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-4337.md): Yoav Weiss ([@yoavw](https://x.com/yoavw)), Dror Tirosh ([@drortirosh](https://x.com/drortirosh)), Alex Forshtat and Shahaf Nacson.

In addition, we‚Äôve already spoken with numerous Account Abstraction community members and teams who expressed a keen interest to participate in the organization effort (i.e help manage the hub in addition to filling up slots). 

3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with?

As the goal of Account Abstraction is to drive adoption, we see room for collaboration with another community hub proposal which has been accepted - [the Adoption Hub](https://forum.devcon.org/t/sea-community-hub-proposal-adoption-hub/3757).


We embrace innovation, collaboration and decentralization üíö Please get in touch with us if you like this DIP and want to contribute!
