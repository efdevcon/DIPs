## Summary of Proposal / Abstract

As proposed in [DIP-17](./DIP-17.md) (Accepted) the "Climate Friendly Devcon VI" Dapp allows Devcon VI attendees to optionally compensate the carbon emissions associated with the event and their air travel to the event on-chain. Attendees who compensated (at least) their event emissions may mint a POAP as proof of participation. This DIP proposes that holders of this POAP receive priority treatment in the queue for vegetarian lunch on the last day of Devcon VI. 

## Rationale

This provides a perk to POAP holders to encourage participation amongst attendees to offset their carbon emissions.

## Implementation

Participants must show their POAP at the lunch queue.

danceratopz & haurog would verify POAP holders at either 1 or 2 of the vegetarian lunch queues. 

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

In order for this perk to have impact, we ask whether it would be possible to advertise the initiative on the last day of Devcon and/or in the Agora Center LED banner.

danceratopz & haurog would take full ownership of verifying POAP holders in the lunch queue.
