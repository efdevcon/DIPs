## Summary of Proposal
 Integrating Reclaim Protocol to verify Identity, offering nationality-based discounts and exclusive access to specific community events. This enhances event inclusivity and ensures secure, decentralized verification, enriching the overall Devcon 7 experience.

## Abstract
This proposal recommends integrating Reclaim Protocol to enhance attendee verification and inclusivity. Our solution offers multiple options for verifying nationality, providing flexibility and speeding up the process to just a few seconds. 

By leveraging zkTLS infrastructure, attendees can securely verify their nationality without revealing additional personal data or installing apps. This streamlined approach facilitates nationality-based discounts and exclusive event access, making ticketing and verification seamless for both crypto-native and non-crypto attendees. This ease of use is expected to attract new users to the Ethereum ecosystem, boosting engagement and expanding the community.

## Motivation & Rationale
Integrating Reclaim Protocol for Identity Verification ensures a secure and inclusive experience:

1. **Enhanced Security:** zkTLS allows Identity verification without disclosing additional personal data, safeguarding privacy.
2. **User-Friendly:** Credentials are generated quickly and easily without requiring extra apps.
3. **Flexible Verification:** Multiple verification options provide users with more choices, and the process is completed in seconds.
4. **Inclusive Benefits:** Nationality-based discounts and exclusive event access promote diversity.
5. **Broad Appeal:** Simplified Identity verification attract both crypto-native and non-crypto users, expanding the Ethereum ecosystem and engaging more participants.

This integration enhances the event experience while emphasizing security, privacy, and inclusivity.

## Implementation
- We will host a website similar to demo.reclaimprotocol.org
- User will be asked to login into a website to generate credentials or Aadhaar website in case of Indians to generate a proof of their identity number.
