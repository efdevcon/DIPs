## Summary of Proposal

Street art as public good - Devcon 6 Graffiti Tour

## Abstract

Exclusive graffiti tour for Devcon6 attendees including a digital experience as a “Street Art Hunting” that rewards them with a memorial NFT of Devcon 6 promoting muralism heritage as a public good.

## Motivation & Rationale

Bogotá is well known worldwide for its street art, at Cryptomurals we (A group of muralist & Ethereum enthusiasts) believe in street art as a public good, we want to keep the record of the layers of murals that has been painted on the same wall to stock them on the Ethereum blockchain and make it accessible to anyone as a public good.

Cryptomurals aims to be a public gallery in the form of an archive that allows anyone to see the history of the best spots & murals worldwide, we call it “The wallchain”, this will be a collaborative process to keep it updated thanks to our international network of street art festivals & high quality muralists.

We propose an exclusive experience for Devcon attendees to discover best murals in downtown with graffiti guides that will guide them to unlock the Devcon6 memorial NFT for free.

## Implementation

__This will be the first Cryptomurals hunt experience thanks to a partnership with DoinGud(https://doingud.com/) and the support of EthColombia(https://www.instagram.com/eth_colombia/) community. __
Attendees will be invited to create a unique ID linked to their Eth wallets and use the Street art hunt platform during the Graffiti tour. They will be able to unlock the 3 murals that will populate the Colombian map puzzle.

Shortly: 3 murals + 3 geolocated spots + 3 artists = 1 Cryptomurals = Free Devcon 6 memorial NFT.
