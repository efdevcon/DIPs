## Summary of Proposal
Roll for initiative! We're bringing tabletop gaming to Devcon, transforming conference downtime into epic quests of strategy, laughter, and community-building. Get ready to level up at Devcon!

## Abstract
Picture this: amidst the buzz of blockchain brilliance, Devcon attendees gather around tables, strategizing their next move in Settlers of Catan or unraveling crypto lore through AceTCG. Welcome to the ultimate conference power-up – tabletop gaming at Devcon! We're assembling a party of passionate gamers and crypto enthusiasts to create daily gaming events that will forge friendships, spark discussions, and provide a much-needed respite from the intense networking. With Game Masters on duty, epic loot for champions, and games that bridge the gap between blockchain concepts and tactile play, we're not just playing games – we're building a stronger, more connected Ethereum community, one roll of the dice at a time!

## Motivation & Rationale
- Conference fatigue? Not on our watch! We're bringing attendees together for meaningful moments of connection through the magic of board games.
- Offers a unique blockchain experience through AceTCG, allowing attendees to engage with crypto concepts in a tangible, game-based format.
- Introduces attendees to novel blockchain use cases through gamification of crypto lore and concepts, making complex topics more accessible and enjoyable.
- Supports the growth of decentralized communities by bringing people together in a relaxed, collaborative environment.

## Implementation
- Our previous quests at Farcon and EDCON were legendary, with players of all levels spending hours engaged in friendly competition and collaboration.
- We'll be collecting feedback faster than you can say "roll for perception," ensuring our tabletop tactics evolve for future Devcons.
- No prior gaming experience required – our Game Masters are here to guide even the newest of noobs to tabletop triumph!

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. Quest objectives:
    - Secure a cozy Devcon location (2-3 tables with chairs) for our gaming guilds
    - Try to inscribe our events in the sacred Devcon schedule
    - Summon Game Masters to oversee our daily adventures (that’s us!)
    - AceTCG and /tabletop will offer legendary loot (prizes like cards and merch) for our champions and lucky raiders
2. Party members:
    - The /tabletop channel: A band of merry gamers on a quest to unite 1000 humans through the power of board games. They're not just players – they're devs crafting tools to connect tabletop enthusiasts and community builders creating a pipeline for game distribution on Farcaster.
    - AceTCG team: The wizards behind a trading card game that brings crypto lore to life. Born from a Gitcoin-funded educational public goods project, we’re on a mission to make blockchain concepts as gripping as the latest fantasy novel.
3. Side quests and alliances:
    - Join forces with blockchain gaming guilds for epic crossover events
    - Align with the sages of educational initiatives to infuse learning with play
    - Transform networking events into unforgettable co-op campaigns
