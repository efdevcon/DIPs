## Summary of Proposal

### Simple Summary
Hosting DevCon Archive Videos on Swarm, via Etherna

## Abstract

Swarm is a decentralized storage and communication system that was incubated by the Ethereum Foundation.
Etherna is a video platform using Swarm as storage
This DIP has one proposal:
To add DevCon Archive Video hosted on Swarm / Etherna like for Devcon Video Archive in 2022.__

## Motivation & Rationale

Implementing this DIP would give users who want to watch DevCon videos more options to choose from. Moreover, it would grow the ecosystem of dApps.

## Implementation
This DIP has already been implemented in 2022, for Devcon Video Archive. 

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)? 
Etherna can operate all the publishing actions, or will provide all tools to Devcon's team to operate autonomously.
Source videos need to be encoded and uploaded to Swarm through Etherna. So, Devcon Archive's git repository needs to be updated with references to uploaded contents, and all this can be automatized with the Video Importer tool: https://github.com/Etherna/etherna-video-importer.
The frontend component, to embed videos into Archive website, has already been built since last Devcon VI.

2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? 
Etherna will be responsible for the implementation of this proposal. 
Swarm will advise Etherna in the development of the project. 

The following people will work to bring the proposal to life:
Etherna:
Mirko Da Corte will be the technical lead and backend dev
Mattia Dalzocchio will be the UX engineer and frontend dev
Federico Cicciarella will be the backend dev

Swarm
Črt Ahlin will be the advisor
Costanza Gallo will act as the bridge between the DevCon team, the Swarm Association and Etherna

3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))

This is a joint project between Swarm and Etherna.
