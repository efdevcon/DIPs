## Summary of Proposal
Hosting the Devcon website with the Agenda of DevCon on Swarm/FairData Society. 
This would make Devcon’ website decentralized, censorship resistant and privacy preserving, and would make Devcon’s digital efforts aligned with its values, and help attendees have an amazing experience__

## Abstract
Swarm is a decentralized storage and communication system that was initially incubated by the Ethereum Foundation.

Fair Data Society is an initiative for decentralized self-sovereign data commons.

This DIP follows the Devcon 2022 Swarm DIP and enhances it:

Hosting the Devcon website and agenda on Swarm/FairData Society.

## Motivation & Rationale

Implementing this DIP would make Devcon’s digital efforts aligned with its principles and values:

The website hosting on the Swarm Network will be web3 native, censorship resistant and privacy preserving. The website will be in control of the Devcon team and not of a centralized provider. 

## Implementation

Yes, implementing the Agenda on Swarm has already been implemented at Devcon 6. The implementation went smoothly, however it has been done the day before the event, so this year we would like to have more time in order to deliver it as soon as possible. 

The 2022 project had two components, an Exporter plugin and a Decentralized Frontend. More details about it can be found in the DIP 18.

In addition, this year we would like to host the main environment of the Agenda and Devcon website on the Swarm Network. The solution has been implemented on other situations like blogposts: https://fairdataprotocol.bzz.link/

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)? 
If this DIP is approved, we need the design specifications to develop the Website and the Agenda. Ideally, we should have a couple of calls in order to prepare a plan for the implementation. 

Moreover, we will need the content, in order to publish the website.

2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? The owner of the DIP, Costanza Gallo (costgallo / costanza@ethswarm.org)

3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))
This project is already an integration between Swarm Network and FDS.
In addition, it could be integrated with the ticketing platform
