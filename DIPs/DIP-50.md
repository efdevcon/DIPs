## Summary of Proposal
The home operator hub will feature education, resources, and one-on-one support for running a node or validator at home. It will be managed by Dappnode, EthStaker, & Ethereum On ARM, and will also feature roundtables, discussion and resources on any protocol that enables a sub-32 ETH validator to participate in staking from home

## Abstract
This event will be community-led, and invitations to projects to participate in the roundtables will be extended only in their capacity to increase node and validator decentralization and serve the community with tools that increase the economic accessibility of running a validator. A moderator will be present in such roundtables with a big “shill button” that will sound an alarm if the speaker switches to “shill mode”. Individual validator troubleshooting will be available all day long, all week long

## Motivation & Rationale

There’s a huge community of home stakers, companies that provide resources and tooling for these stakers, and protocols looking to onboard more home stakers who will all be looking to connect with each other at Devcon. This usually results in a wealth of different events hosted by all these parties looking to bring this cohort of people together. There’s an enormous amount of interest in staking and we’d love for people to know where to go to learn more, learn how to evaluate their options, or get support if they’re an existing staker!

## Implementation
Workshops have been available at most Ethereum conferences but this gives a central hub for it to happen and offers a way for potentially interested stakers to go to a neutral location and determine the best way to stake from home for their specific situation

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)?
"Resources required" section should cover our needs. EthStaker, DAppNode, & Ethereum on ARM will staff the area and provide the people power to pull it off
2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? (i.e. working on Day 0)
Members of the EthStaker, DAppNode, & Ethereum on ARM teams
3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))
Any project or protocol that facilitates people running validators from home and contributing to the decentralization of Ethereum!
