## Summary of Proposal
The W3 (Women in Web3) Community Hub intends to be a gathering place for all communities who value diversity, equity, and inclusion of women in their work. Our hub will welcome women and women supporters to learn about Web3 in a safe and thriving space. Our hub will serve as a safe and nurturing space for female newbies and builders to network, mingle and learn from others in the web3 space.

## Abstract
The Women in Web3 Hub will act as a place for women to come and learn, network and have a space to dig deeper into the web3 technology. We will have discussions around technology, career paths as well as small spaces focused on interesting and emerging topics in the space. 

## Motivation & Rationale
This hub serves as a vital complement to the main program at Devcon by offering a focused platform where women and women supporters can engage in meaningful conversations, educational sessions, and networking opportunities tailored specifically to their needs and interests.       

The significance of this topic lies in its ability to address the underrepresentation of women in the blockchain space and empower them to actively participate and excel in the Web3 ecosystem. By creating a community hub that entails networking, talks and workshops at the main conference, we aim to cultivate a more intimate and supportive environment where participants - women and women supporters can engage in deeper discussions, form lasting connections, and explore diverse perspectives in a more inclusive setting. 
   
Additionally we would like to enable the hub to become an opportunity hub for women in the web3 space where companies can hire and involve more female employees and web3 projects or foundations can offer more funding and grant opportunities for women-led projects.        

Through this innovative format, the W3 Community Hub not only amplifies the voices of women in tech but also paves the way for greater collaboration, learning, and growth of diversity within the Ethereum community.

## Implementation
In addition to the support provided by the Devcon team, our Hub will require specific production resources to ensure a seamless and enriching experience for our attendees. We plan to source additional equipment to enhance the space, tentatively including comfortable seating for various sessions, floor pillows for more intimate discussions, a projector and screen for presentations, desks for hands-on workshops, whiteboards for interactive sessions, and speakers with ambient music to create a welcoming and empowering atmosphere.
