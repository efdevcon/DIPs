## Summary of Proposal
The Regen Hub at Devcon 7 will be an inclusive and vibrant space dedicated to showcasing regenerative web3 projects, with a focus on Southeast Asia. It will provide opportunities for local and global Ethereum builders to connect and engage in meaningful discussions about decentralization and community-driven action.

## Abstract
The Regen Hub is a community-focused initiative aimed at spotlighting local web3 and regenerative efforts, particularly from the Thai and Southeast Asian regions. The hub will offer a collaborative space for discussions on topics such as local empowerment, regenerative agriculture, and decentralized ecosystems. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in roundtable discussions, networking events, and interactive sessions, fostering collaboration between local builders and global Ethereum developers.

Building on the success of the Regen Hub at Devcon 6 in Bogotá, this year’s hub will feature new elements to enhance both the local and global participant experience. Showcases of regional initiatives and educational resources will be available to encourage future collaborations within the web3 ecosystem.

## Motivation & Rationale
- **How would this enhance attendee experience?**  
  The Regen Hub will provide a welcoming space for deep conversations about the intersection of web3 and regenerative initiatives, offering a platform for attendees to discover impactful projects and network with regional builders.
  
- **How is this solution better than a non-blockchain experience?**  
  The hub emphasizes how blockchain, specifically Ethereum, can drive regenerative efforts. Attendees will explore unique use cases only possible through decentralized ecosystems, such as biochar-based regenerative agriculture and decentralized crowdfunding platforms.

- **How does this proposal introduce attendees to a novel blockchain/Ethereum use case?**  
  The hub will showcase real-world regenerative projects that demonstrate the potential of Ethereum and web3 solutions to create local and global impact through decentralized action.

## Implementation
- **Has any part of this proposal been implemented at other events?**  
  Yes, the Regen Hub was successfully implemented at Devcon 6 in Bogotá. The lessons learned from that event will be applied to enhance the experience at Devcon 7.

- **Do you require feedback or data from attendees post-event?**  
  Yes, attendee feedback will be collected to assess the effectiveness of the networking activities and knowledge-sharing sessions. This data will inform future improvements to the Regen Hub.

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. **What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon?**  
   We will need logistical support to set up the hub with necessary equipment such as seating, tables, and audiovisual tools. Coordination with local projects and speakers to finalize the programming will also be required.

2. **Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively?**  
   Lead organizers Guil Maueler and Corinna Schlicht will manage the hub, with Sam Chua overseeing local project integration and Jeremy Akers facilitating community engagement activities.

3. **What other projects could this proposal be integrated with?**  
   Potential collaborations include ETHKL, Pagoda, and other Southeast Asia-based social innovation networks, along with regenerative initiatives from the wider Ethereum community.
