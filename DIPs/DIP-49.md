Created: 2024-09-18

-----Summary of Proposal-----
Last week’s news of Meta Spark winding down devastated many creators around the globe. This news alongside many others we’ve read over the years act as a strong reminder that what we create on the internet today does not belong to us – the patrons of the internet.

This hub aims to help attendees understand the future of onchain creativity and its potential to drive mainstream Ethereum adoption, brought to you by a group of builders with technical expertise and industry knowledge on the multifaceted challenges and opportunities within the onchain creator space. By understanding the Onchain Creator Economy, you will also learn about how onchain creators are collectively earning millions of dollars in rewards through applications built on Ethereum.

Through demos, workshops and panel discussions, attendees will walk away with new knowledge and exciting ideas on how we as patrons of the internet can truly capture value for the things that we create on the internet.


-----Motivation & Rationale-----
#### How would this community hub enhance attendee experience?

Consumer crypto is one of the most prominent ways to onboard the next millions and billions of users - and one of the core drivers is onchain creation. This hub will be a dedicated space for creators, developers, and enthusiasts to connect and collaborate on the future of onchain creativity through hands-on demonstrations of onchain creation tools, platforms and protocols, networking opportunities with like-minded individuals building within the onchain creator space. 

#### How would this compliment the main programme that is happening at Devcon?

While the main programme at Devcon is likely to focus on technical aspects and broader Ethereum developments, this community hub offers a deep-dive into the creative side of the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a bridge between technical discussions and real-world applications. It will also demonstrate the tangible impact of Ethereum on creative and cultural applications. Attendees will get to connect with teams that are actively building within the Onchain Creator space e.g. Zora, Ethereum Story, Base, Uniswap, Archetype, Optimism, Mint, 2077, Cyber, Superchain.eco.

#### Why is this topic significant, and why is a community hub the best format to address it instead of a talk or workshop at the main conference?

The majority of creators today live on platforms like Instagram; most likely have not learnt about the positive impact of creating onchain.

Onchain creators represent a major driver for mainstream Ethereum adoption as the technology helps unlock new economic models and ownership opportunities for the creative industry. A community hub is the best format for this topic because it allows for informal discussions, hands-on experimentation, organic exchange of ideas and is ultimately a more inclusive environment for both technical and non-technical individuals who are interested in Onchain Creator space.


-----Implementation-----

The general theme of this hub is an “Open Creation Space” where attendees can experiment with tools and connect with the team throughout the programme.

**Production requirements**

Our collective is made up of individuals well-suited to drive this hub for our diverse and complementary understanding of Onchain Creators. Our experience spans across creating industry-leading infrastructures (Base, OP, Cyber, Mint), driving adoption through world-class applications (Zora, Uniswap, Crowdmuse), building communities (2077, Superchain.eco) and expanding the narrative of Onchain Creativity (Archetype, EthereumStory).
