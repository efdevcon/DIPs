## Summary of Proposal


# Abstract
> Ethereum is global, and bringing Devcon to Southeast Asia is in line with our goal of reaching more local Ethereum communities, as well as increasing diversity within the overall Ethereum community. The Ethereum community is in many ways still western-dominated, despite the fact that crypto is more practically used in Southeast Asia. To illustrate that, four countries within Southeast Asia rank in the top 20 of the Global Crypto Adoption Index, with Vietnam and the Philippines at #1 and #2.

- this is a proposal put forth on behalf of clr.fund who has been working with local ethereum communities to conduct quadratic funding (QF) rounds
- did [QF round at ETHColombia](https://ethcolombia.clr.fund/#/) for Devcon VI, 292K to support 38 communities and projects
- several nascent communities and upswell of support in SEA now that DevconSEA has been announced
- existing group of projects that are just starting out with the [Road to Devcon grants](https://blog.ethereum.org/en/2023/06/29/road-to-devcon7-grants) initiative that is helping to increase accessibility and opportunities for people to learn, engage, and contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem.
- we do get strong participation in activities in SEA
    - 50+ attendees for ETHPadThai's [christmas event](https://x.com/ethpadthai/status/1738633827881513084?s=20)
    - [up and coming](https://x.com/EFDevcon/status/1732722766196179318?s=20) local initiatives involving students, dev communities, and more
    - we love art with Ethereum Singapore [twitter space](https://x.com/ethereum_sg/status/1744531938356981955?s=20) had 400+ people listen in
- perfect time to use [Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI)]
(https://maci.pse.dev/) to conduct a QF round as other sybil solutions are not as widespread in SEA

# Rationale
- As part of the Ethereum philosophy of subtraction, we will want to eventually have local ethereum communities be self-sustaining and thriving
- This would mean that they could benefit from using funding mechanisms that improve participation amongst their communities, are sufficiently transparent to motivate projects to contribute public goods, and funders to feel confident that they are able to support meaningful work done for their local ecosystems
- A possible state would be for local projects that are revenue generating and self-sufficient to have a culture of contributing back to local, well-run, and Ethereum-focused communities. Thereby, keeping the overall ecosystem sustainable and healthy for new participants and to remain a safe space for current members.

**Why Devcon is a natural schelling point**
- Devcon is the undisputed reunion of the Ethereum ecosystem where cultural norms and behaviours can be encouraged by setting the right examples.
- With DevconSEA, several Ethereum communities in SEA have kickstarted their activities, many countries have begun running their own conferences, hackathons, and regular meetups in anticipation.

**Overcoming constraints to adoption**
- We'd like to kickstart these initiatives with some support and set the right examples while testing existing funding infrastructure limitations in SEA.
- For example, a quick survey was done with community leaders and current sybil solutions such as BrightID have not been widely adopted which might hinder the QF mechanism from working properly.

**Sustaining our local ecosystems**
- In the longer term, we will hope to see more local communities continue running their own rounds much like after Devcon VI which inspired rounds in [Argentina and Honduras too](https://mirror.xyz/ethhonduras.eth/qzG8eksLdK4M3rLEQ6msPA9NLbiYSWJURiwW45teZHs).

## Implementation
- run a QF round using clr.fund's tools
- this was been done before for Devcon VI [at ETHColombia](https://ethcolombia.clr.fund/#/)

## Operational Requirements & Ownership
This will be run by clr.fund in collaboration with local SEA communities.

**Round Details**

**Goals:** to educate SEA communities on QF (its benefits, when to use, operations) and lay the ground work for a larger ecosystem round during DevconSEA.

**Proposed size:** max 30k in matching funds, expect 200-500 donors

**Round Qualification:** only RTD grantees and Ethereum-specific communities that have run meetups/events prior to 2024

**Timeline:**
5 Feb - 20 Feb: actively engage participants 
- onboarding
- sharing best practices
- publicity campaign, talking about their work and also our hopes for Devcon
- sharing about QF to communities
- open to sponsors to the matching funds
    
20 Feb - 4 March: QF round execution
    
9 March: finalise round and disbursement + continue our engagements
- now that the broader Ethereum ecosystem knows about our initiatives in SEA, open up conversations about how they could support the larger round during DevconSEA
- encourage round participants to support each others' initiatives throughout the year

**Limitations:** as brightID isn't commonly used in SEA, we will need to have a constrained round to prevent sybil attacking. We define a constrained round as constraining projects eligible for QF to only RTD grantees and Ethereum-specific communities that have run meetups/events prior to 2024
