### Summary of Proposal
We want to produce a short documentary about Devcon and the Ethereum developer community.

### Abstract  
This proposal is about creating video content to promote what is arguably the best part of Ethereum and an unfair advantage that Ethereum has over other L1 chains - Devcon and the Ethereum developer community.

So we will spend this Devcon talking to and interviewing as many developers and community builders in the Ethereum community to produce a 10-15 min documentary about it.

### Motivation & Rationale  
One big thing that Ethereum has going for it, but is often underappreciated - is the Ethereum developer community. Devcon recordings are what got me into Ethereum back in 2016, and I think Devcon is the heart of the Ethereum developer community. No price talks, no shills, just building.

We think this is something worth explaining and highlighting.

### Implementation  
We‘ll be interviewing people about their experience at Devcon, why they are there, the community and culture surrounding Ethereum, and how things have changed from Devcon 0 to Devcon 7 Bangkok. Besides Devcon itself, we‘ll also be talking about early presentations and promises, comparing it to where we are today.

We plan on recording footage around the venue and interviews for a few hours per day, then edit it down into a 20-30min documentary that tries to explain the culture and impact of Devcon as well as Ethereum as a whole.
