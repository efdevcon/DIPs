## Abstract

Create a symbolic ritual where the last Devcon city/country host brings its culture and passes the Eth values to the new city/country host of Devcon creating links among faraway communities.

## Rationle

We are inspired on the original Olympics values: 
- Encourage Effort (Excellence)
- Preserve Human Dignity (Respect)
- Develop Harmony (Friendship)
unifying them with the Devcon objective of caring about technology impact & the Infinite Garden & Ethos of Ethereum as an equal opportunity technology for coordination and prosperity.

### Implementation

This activity will be held ideally in 2 times:

#### 1. Passing the torch

We would like to create a special moment where one or two representatives of the last Devcon pass the torch vibes to the new one.

In this case will be from **BogotÃ¡ to Bangkok** represented by **ETHâ€¢CO & ETH PADTHAI** community leaders with a short but emotive/inspirational speech immortalized with the physical ETHâ€¢TORCH specially designed by the talented @0xnats from ETHâ€¢CO @ethejecafetero community.

We believe this could become an optional ritual for future Devcon versions promoting *union, harmony & prosperity.*

#### 2. Caring the torch during Devcon

We will be caring the torch during Devcon7 SEA in the **GM Community Hub** where ETHâ€¢CO will participate.

In this space we will be hosting a co-creation session of the Etherean Latinx community to share our learnings from the last 2 years since the last Devcon.
