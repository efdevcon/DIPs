## Summary of Proposal
NEON TEMPLE : A place for arts, communications, fun, and mementos

The all inclusive common ground for people with different backgrounds to share their minds freely on walls with glowing neon colours markers, decorating themselves for photos, as well as enjoying artworks inspired by Ethereum ecosystem submitted from all over the world in the SEA NEON TEMPLE themed area under blacklight.

## Abstract
While Ethereum ecosystem is all inclusive, there are still very little events which act as the common ground for attendees with different backgrounds, especially in art and tech. Art is often taken as mere decoration or competition when art is an important tool to communicate important ideas in a friendly way to wide range of audience, let alone moving the culture. Having a place for art in Devcon could make an impact in initiating more collaboration and understanding among people with different backgrounds.

To implement the idea, traditional SEA temple can be a suitable metaphorical representation. In SEA temple is not only a place for enlightenment, but also a place for community, education, and arts. In Devcon context, the SEA temple could be the place for community enhanced with a solar punk / neon visual aesthetics where attendees come together to express themselves freely by decorating outfits and/or writing on walls with glowing neon paints under black light while enjoying artworks under the theme “Infinite Garden Flowers” displayed in the area. The flower artworks can be submitted by anyone. Every time someone submit their flowers, the infinite garden grows richer and more abundant.

## Motivation & Rationale
Ever since the development of smart contract, digital arts have found it's strong voice for the first time in the art history. The so-called "digital renaissance" art movement as well as art communities have been gradually developed alongside the growth of Ethereum ecosystem. Technology itself can become an artwork, while artworks can be a powerful tools to communicate technological ideas and philosophies to wide range of people. Theoretically the border lines between people and professions are getting blurred by development of technology, but practically Art and Tech communities are separated by numbers of factors such as social media algorithm and/or lack of common grounds for everyone to learn more about different fields of expertises. Having a place for Art in Devcon is not only creating an impact on being the leading Ethereum event which acts as a common ground for Art and Tech to freely co-exist in the ecosystem, but also initiating collaboration and understanding among people with different backgrounds.

Just like how we understand music by listening to and/or playing music. The way to appreciate arts is by perceiving, immersing oneself into the experience, as well as getting involved in the creative process and producing art.

By metaphorically bringing SEA temple atmosphere into the Devcon context with solar punk inspired visual aesthetic of neon colours under blacklight, the NEON TEMPLE acts as a friendly place for attendees with wide range of backgrounds to become inspired with the blockchain technology, decentralisation philosophy and values through the arts displayed in the area and connections they make with other people while expressing themselves through writing on participatory art wall together. 

With thousands of attendees, making new connection can be practically quite overwhelming. Having an area which could blur the lines between backgrounds and professions through fun and participatory activities could help attendees break the ice, getting to know each other, and create a cross expertise connection in real life. 

##  Implementation 
The idea of NEON TEMPLE is an adaptation from existing temples, participatory walls, and neon parties. 

Although it’s not in the blockchain context, temples in Thailand normally have temple fairs and festivals at night where temple areas are decorated with colourful lighting. The atmospheres are usually fun and exciting. Outdoor fairs can be affected by mosquitoes and unexpected heat / weather. Indoor events are more controllable and more favourable to attendees.

Participatory walls are normally implemented in many art events around the world. It can be quite popular and fill up quickly. Sometimes people write unexpected things. But as the free wall, having different view points and expressions written is a beauty in itself.

Neon party could be quite fun for people of all age. But there is a possibility of getting dizzy for people who usually suffer from migraines. Pointing black light to the wall instead of the crowd could greatly solve the problem. Although the effect of neon could be less strong, partially dark area makes attendees adjust with lights better than completely dark room. 

## Operational Requirements & Ownership

**1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)?**

**Prior to the event**

- Creating a website / providing a cloud space / creating a system for artwork submission. Submitted artworks from this pool will be displayed on LED screen in the NEON TEMPLE area. The website can also become the participation archive after the event is over.
- Making an announcement of the non-curatorial open call for artwork submission with the theme “Infinite Garden Flowers”. Anyone can submit their own version of flowers through the website.  
- Designing the space (floor plan, participant circulation, space usage, lighting, look and feel, decoration item, etc).  
- Preparing design items according to the architectural design above which need to be manufactured before the event i.e. main visuals, signages, prints to be attached on walls (if any)  

**At the venue**

- Setting up an area for the NEON TEMPLE where lighting can be controlled. 
- Setting up LED black light. 
- Setting up big LED display for the arts as well as an equipment to control the display. 
- Linking artwork submission data from the pool to the LED display. 
- Setting up black wall for visitors to write on. 
- Setting up a station(s) for neon markers, neon tapes, decoration supplies as well as some seating areas 
- Decorating the area  

**During the event**

- Checking if LED display runs properly. 
- Checking if art supplies are sufficient and well distributed.  
- Live drawing on the wall to encourage people to participate.  


**2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively?**

As I am based in Bangkok, I will be able to start working on it from end of August onward. I can certainly coordinate with DevCon team as well as event planner from QSNCC on the visual design aspects.

There will also be 8-10 of the ArtGumiDAO artist community members from Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Philippines flying to Bangkok to help with the project around the end of October and stay at my place until the end of the DevCon event.

We look forward to work with Devcon team on creating the space. We can help handling the visual designs of the look and feel of the area, on-site artistic implementation such as decorating the area, coordinating with event coordinators and equipment technicians, preparing art supplies (i.e. neon markers, small decoration items), as well as doing the live painting during the event.

We do need help from professional lighting technician, LED display technician, and construction technician to set up big structures (i.e. walls, lighting frames works, LED control board). 

We also need help on setting up a website / cloud space / creating artwork submission system.  


**3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :)**

We are looking forward to collaborate with the music proposal by Shaka https://forum.devcon.org/t/infinite-art-garden-space-for-live-music-visuals-dance-and-painting/3581


## Links & Additional Information
To answer questions raised during the meeting with Devcon team.

- Minimum Usage Area = 90 square meters
- LED Screen & Buffer Area = 25 square meters (4.5 x 2.5 m LED display)
- Interactive Walls Area = 10 square meters (2 x 10 m wall + 0.5 m buffer in front of each wall)
- Space for Visitors & staff = 40 square meters (30 - 40 people at a time including staff)
- Space for Tables = 12 square meters
- Wall space 2 of 10 x 2.5 m wall can afford roughly 550 people (30 x 30 cm writing space each). But practically writing space will be varied. Incase of insufficient wall space, blank papers can be provided. 
- Sizes of space and walls can be adjusted.
